Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # random_string.random will be created
  + resource "random_string" "random" {
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + length      = 16
      + lower       = true
      + min_lower   = 0
      + min_numeric = 0
      + min_special = 0
      + min_upper   = 0
      + number      = true
      + numeric     = true
      + result      = (known after apply)
      + special     = true
      + upper       = true
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
